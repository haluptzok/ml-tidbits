# ml-tidbits

Small, focused ML utilities in **Python/PyTorch** and **C++** that emphasize **clarity**, **latency**, and **practicality**.  
Each component is self-contained with docs, tests, and (when relevant) a C++ counterpart.

> First addition: **UnifiedMonotonicSpline** â€” a unified, batched **monotone rational linear spline** layer with forward/inverse modes and increasing/decreasing directions.
